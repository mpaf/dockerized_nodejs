This repository holds a self-contained Node JS application that connects to a Mongodb local database.

Use Docker and fig to run the application. First you clone it with git, and if you have docker and fig installed in your system, all you have to do is run

```fig up```
  
And wait for the container to build and run. After it finishes just open your browser at:
